## About
I have created a car management system canister where you can perform crud operations.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository

    ```

2. Install dependencies

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the IC local development environment

    ```bash
    dfx start --background --clean
    ```

4. Deploy the canisters to the local development environment

    ```bash
    dfx deploy
    ```
5. Make these changes to the code for good code structrue
```The code works well structured and use case are well thought of however,
Consider handling and logging errors more securely, especially when displaying error messages to users..
Depending on your use case, consider adding proper access controls and authentication.
Consider adding comments to explain the purpose of functions and how they work.
This makes it easier for other developers to understand and maintain the code.

```
